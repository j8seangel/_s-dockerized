_s vitamined with Docker and sass compiler
===

I'm just a development environment for the https://github.com/Automattic/_s theme using docker and node-sass for sass files compiling.

Preparing the environment with docker
---------------

1. Install docker: https://docs.docker.com/mac/
2. Run `docker-compose up`
3. Just go to 192.168.99.100:8080 and enjoy with your new wordpress prepared for developing the new base theme!

Getting Started
---------------

1. Read and follow https://github.com/Automattic/_s#readme
2. Update the theme name in docker-compose.yml.

Develop
---------------

Run `npm install` and `npm run sass` to compile the css.

Now you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)

Enjoy ! ðŸ˜„
